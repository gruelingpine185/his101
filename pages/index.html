            <h1>A People to Remember - Sumerians</h1>
            <p>Communication is one of the most important and fascinating components of civilization. It takes on numerous forms such as verbal speech, body language, expression, written language, and many more. Today, such forms can be expressed though three main ways: physically, digitally, and artistically. This article will discuss how Sumerians tackled a growing language barrier issue</p>
            <h2>Language and Writing</h2>

            <p>The Sumerians of the Mesopotamian city Uruk were an early example of communication in civilization. With a rapid growth in immigrant population due to urbanization, and being both a major religious and trade center, Sumerians needed a way to overcome language barriers with as little complication as possible. They likely went through several iterations before landing on pictograms and ideograms, powerful colloquializations and universal languages. Sumerians used reed styluses to engrave into clay tablets.</p>
            <h2>Technology</h2>

            <p>It's no surprize that Mesopotamian civilizations had to be incredibly resourceful. The land is barren of timber and construction-ready stone, however, it has both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers which supplied food, water, silt, and clay. Despite the absence of mineral deposits, Sumerians were specialists in metallurgy. They relied extensively on trade to import raw materials such as copper for their tools and weaponry. Some time later, bronze was adopted for is structural rigidity and lethality on the battle field. Bronze also had properties that made the casting process easier.</p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Economics</h2>
            <p>We know temples to be the house of God. For the Sumerians, temples also served as a place of business. In them, priests would collect and redistribute goods from passer-bys and locals. Integrating trade with religion comes with an interesting political side effect; that is, surrendering independence to an invading power would be an insult to their god, and it detrimental to the economy. For those reasons, Sumer and other Mesopotamian city-states developed powerful militaries. Egalitarian slavery existed and was effective as a method of debt-paying and serving time as prisoners of war. Enslaved individuals often be under the temple helping out with agriculture.</p>
