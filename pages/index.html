            <!-- <p>Communication is one of the most important and fascinating components of civilization. It takes on numerous forms such as verbal speech, body language, expression, written language, and many more. Today, such forms can be expressed though three main ways: physically, digitally, and artistically. This article will discuss how Sumerians tackled a growing language barrier issue,</p> -->
            <h2>Language and Writing</h2>

            <p>The Sumerians of the Mesopotamian city Uruk were an early example of communication in civilization. With a rapid growth in immigrant population due to urbanization, and being both a major religious and trade center, Sumerians needed a way to overcome language barriers with as little complication as possible. They likely went through several iterations before landing on pictograms and ideograms, powerful colloquializations and universal languages. Sumerians used reed styluses to engrave into clay tablets.</p>
            <h2>Technology</h2>

            <p>It's no surprize that Mesopotamian civilizations had to be incredibly resourceful. The land is barren of timber and construction-ready stone, however, it has both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers which supplied food, water, silt, and clay. Despite the absence of mineral deposits, Sumerians were specialists in metallurgy. They relied extensively on trade to import raw materials such as copper for their tools and weaponry. Some time later, bronze was adopted for is structural rigidity and lethality on the battle field. Bronze also had properties that made the casting process easier.</p>
            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <div class="img-container">

                <p class="caption">Four statuettes of the Mesopotamian god Gudea</p>
            </div>
            <p>Sumerians were a polytheistic people, naming their gods after things found on naturally. For example, <em>An</em> is the sky god and <em>Ki</em> is the earth god. Their gods created humans to serve them, providing them with fines housing, food, and attire. A relationship between humans and the gods was established because of the gods dependencies of the humans. Humans were to satisfy the gods and in return, the gods will give gifts. Religion was also interconnected with the political arrangement. Kings stood as human representatives of the gods and therefore were supplied with finest of supplies also.</p>
            <h2>Economics</h2>

                <p class="caption">Ruins from a temple in Naffur</p>
            </div>
            <p>We know temples to be the house of God. For the Sumerians, temples also served as a place of business. In them, priests would collect and redistribute goods from passer-bys and locals. Integrating trade with religion comes with an interesting political side effect; that is, surrendering independence to an invading power would be an insult to their god, and it detrimental to the economy. For those reasons, Sumer and other Mesopotamian city-states developed powerful militaries. Egalitarian slavery existed and was effective as a method of debt-paying and serving time as prisoners of war. Enslaved individuals would often be under the temple's command helping out with the agriculture labor.</p>
            <h2>Poetry</h2>
            <div class="img-container">

            </div>
            <p>Sumerians were storytellers. Believe it or not, these people used literary elements to enhance their stories like we do today. For poems, they used repetition and syntax structure. They told poems (mythological epics) that highlight the power praise their leaders deserve and the heroic qualities they expressed. Although not entirely understood, these epics have been written for Uruk rulers such as Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, and Gilgamish.</p>
